|Issues are being closed|[evidence in GH](https://github.com/1360119047/calorieApp_server/issues)|
|DOI badge: exists|in GH|
|Docs: doco generated, format not ugly |in GH|
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) |[GH docs](https://github.com/1360119047/calorieApp_server/tree/main/docs)|
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|[GH docs](https://github.com/1360119047/calorieApp_server/tree/main/docs)|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|[in GH](https://github.com/1360119047/calorieApp_server/tree/main#burnout-fuel-your-fitness-journey)|
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|
|Use of version control tools|GH|
|Use of style checkers |config files in GH showing your config|https://github.com/1360119047/calorieApp_server/blob/main/.github/workflows/style_checker.yml|
|Use of code formatters. |[GH Actions (black)](https://github.com/1360119047/calorieApp_server/blob/main/.github/workflows/code_formatter.yml)|
|Use of syntax checkers. |[GH Actions (ruff)](https://github.com/1360119047/calorieApp_server/blob/main/.github/workflows/syntax_checker.yml)|
|Use of code coverage |[GH Actions (pytest-cov)](https://github.com/1360119047/calorieApp_server/blob/main/.github/workflows/code_cov.yml)|
|Other automated analysis tools|[config files in GH](https://github.com/1360119047/calorieApp_server/blob/main/.github/workflows/unit_test.yml)|
|Test cases exist|[dozens of tests](https://github.com/1360119047/calorieApp_server/blob/main/tests/test_application.py) and those test cases are more than [30% of the code base](https://github.com/1360119047/calorieApp_server#testing)|
|Test cases are routinely executed|[GH Actions (pytest-cov)](https://github.com/1360119047/calorieApp_server/actions/workflows/code_cov.yml)|
|The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up|https://github.com/1360119047/calorieApp_server/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md|
|Issues are discussed before they are closed|[GH Issues](https://github.com/1360119047/calorieApp_server/issues)|
|Chat channel: exists|Community/Support Discord|
|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|If a test case fails, [open an issue and fix it](https://github.com/1360119047/calorieApp_server/issues)|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files|[Environment Setup](https://github.com/1360119047/calorieApp_server#environment-setup)|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. [config files in the repo](https://github.com/1360119047/calorieApp_server#environment-setup), updated by lots of different people)|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools| (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)|
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base|https://github.com/1360119047/calorieApp_server/graphs/contributors|
|Short release cycles | (hard to see in short projects) project members are [committing often enough](https://github.com/deekay2310/calorieApp_server/compare/main...1360119047:calorieApp_server:main) so that everyone can get your work, [GH releases](https://github.com/1360119047/calorieApp_server/releases) |
